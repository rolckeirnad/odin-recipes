    <h1>Pizza Cupcakes</h1>
    <img src="../img/pizza-cupcake-01.jpg" alt="Pizza Cupcakes">
    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>They're portable, sort of like a mini pizza, except shaped like a cupcake. They're a great savory snack and a great addition to a game day buffet. Feel free to customize to your family's tastes with additions like ham, sausage, bell peppers, salami, mushrooms, olives, jalapenos, etc. I recommend not omitting the tomato, that really adds something special.</p>
    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>Cooking spray</li>
      <li>8 medium cherry tomatoes</li>
      <li>1 can refrigerated pizza crust</li>
      <li>8 teaspoons shredded mozzarella cheese</li>
      <li>1/2 cup pizza sauce</li>
      <li>8 teaspoons finely chopped red onion</li>
      <li>1/2 cup shredded mozzarella cheese</li>
      <li>8 slices pepperoni, quartered</li>
      <li>Italian seasoning to taste</li>
      <li>Red pepper flakes to taste</li>
      <li>Garlic salt to taste</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
      <li>
        <h3>Step 1</h3>
        <p>Preheat the oven to 400 degrees F (200 degrees C). Spray 8
          cups of a muffin tin with cooking spray.
        </p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <h3>Step 2</h3>
        <p>Finely chop cherry tomatoes and drain any liquid. Set aside.</p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <h3>Step 3</h3>
        <p>Unroll pizza crust on a floured work surface and roll out 
          thinly into a large rectangle. Using a 4-inch round cookie or 
          biscuit cutter, cut 8 circles in the dough. Place dough circles
          in the prepared muffin cups, pressing dough into the bottom and
          up the sides of each cup.
        </p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <h3>Step 4</h3>
        <p>Drop 1 teaspoon mozzarella into each cup. Top with 1 
          tablespoon of pizza sauce. Add chopped tomatoes and red 
          onions. Add 1 tablespoon of mozzarella to each cup, and top 
          with pepperoni. Sprinkle each cup with Italian seasoning, 
          red pepper flakes, and garlic salt to taste.
        </p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <h3>Step 5</h3>
        <p>Bake in the preheated oven until cheese is bubbling and melted, 
          14 to 15 minutes. Remove from the oven and let cool in the tin 
          for about 5 minutes. Remove from the tin and serve hot.
